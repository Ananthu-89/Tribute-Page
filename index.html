           <h4 id="quote"> “It is incredible how many careers he has touched. Twenty-six seasons is difficult to get your head around. Ten years is an awful long time for a manager to be at a club in football but Sir Alex went on and on. He has a very strong desire to give his best every single day. That is what he does. He puts everything he has in.” - Ruud van Nistelrooy</h4>
